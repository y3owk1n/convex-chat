This is a fun project that me playing around with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) that i just discovered. Started with [Convex Chat App Tutorial](https://docs.convex.dev/getting-started/basics/chat-app) and extended a little bit more on authentication and authorization based on actions.

Live Demo -

## Stacks

- Framework - [NextJS with Typescript](https://nextjs.org/)
- Database - [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)
- CSS - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Auth - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

For now Convex is still in beta, but it's really an interesting project.
